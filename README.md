# Show and Hide in React

A quick demo of showing and hiding content in react (Tab style).

See running code at https://MikeTheReader.github.io/show-and-hide

## Reasoning

In old-school Javascript/HTML, when you want to show or hide content, you render it and then change the style to `display:none`. However, in React, if you don't want something to show on the screen, you just don't render it. It's a different way of thinking about the problem, but in the end becomes much cleaner as you don't have to worry about hiding and showing different elements all the time.
